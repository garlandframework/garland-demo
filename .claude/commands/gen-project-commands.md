# Generate Project Commands

Analyse this project and generate MTO test generation command files tailored to it.
The output replaces manual authoring of gen commands — every class name, factory method, field constraint, and import must reflect the actual project, not a template.

**Usage:** `/gen-project-commands`

No arguments. Run once from the project root after `/setup` has generated the test infrastructure.

---

## Output structure

Generate **one set of four files per domain** found in the project, each domain in its own subdirectory. A domain is any named subpackage under the tests root (e.g. `users`, `orders`, `payments`).

```
.claude/commands/
  users/
    gen-endpoint-test.md     → /users/gen-endpoint-test
    gen-flow-test.md         → /users/gen-flow-test
    gen-component-test.md    → /users/gen-component-test
    gen-e2e-test.md          → /users/gen-e2e-test

  orders/
    gen-endpoint-test.md     → /orders/gen-endpoint-test
    gen-flow-test.md         → /orders/gen-flow-test
    gen-component-test.md    → /orders/gen-component-test
    gen-e2e-test.md          → /orders/gen-e2e-test
```

Each file contains only what is relevant to its domain. Do not mix factories, mappers, or constraints from different domains in the same file.

Re-running `/gen-project-commands` overwrites all existing domain directories and regenerates them from the current project state.

---

## Step 1 — Analyse the project

Before generating anything, read the following. Do not guess — read the actual files.

### Test infrastructure
- `BaseTest` — what clients are declared (`httpClient`, `postgresClient`, `kafkaClient`, `mongoClient`, and any domain-specific Kafka clients like `orderKafkaClient`), what their types are, which Kafka topics each client is configured with (first topic determines where `publish()` sends)
- Request factory classes (`TestXxxRequests`) — every method signature, URL, HTTP method, expected status
- Test data factory classes (`TestXxx`, `TestAddresses`, `TestCars`, etc.) — every static method and builder pattern
- Test mapper class (`XxxTestMapper`) — every method and its direction (e.g. `UserDto → UserEntity`, `UserEntity → UserCreatedEvent`)
- `Connections` or equivalent — base URLs, topic names, database names
- Error DTO classes — the exact class names and factory methods used for 400, 404, 409 responses

### Source code
- Controllers — every endpoint: HTTP method, path, request body type, response body type, path variables
- Request / DTO classes with validation annotations — extract every `@NotBlank`, `@NotNull`, `@Size(max=N)`, `@Positive`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@Valid` annotation per field, including nested objects and collections
- Entity classes — field names and types (for DB assertion context)
- Event classes — field names (for Kafka assertion context)
- Document classes — field names (for MongoDB assertion context)
- Kafka topic names — from `@KafkaListener` annotations or event publisher classes

### Project layout
- Identify the test module root package
- Identify all domain subpackages (`endpoint`, `flow`, `component`, e2e class location)
- List every domain found (e.g. `users`, `orders`, `payments`)

### Cross-domain dependencies
For each domain, inspect its request/DTO classes and factory methods for fields that reference another domain's types or IDs.

Examples of cross-domain dependencies to detect:
- `OrderRequest.userId` — orders depends on users (needs a real user UUID)
- `PaymentRequest.orderId` — payments depends on orders
- A factory method that calls another domain's request factory internally

For each dependency found, record:
- Which domain depends on which
- Which specific factory method and DTO field create the dependency
- What the dependent domain needs to call to satisfy it (e.g. `TestUserRequests.createUser()` → returns `UserDto.uuid`)
- Whether the factory provides a `PLACEHOLDER_<DOMAIN>_ID` — note that this is **only valid for validation (400) tests**; happy-path (2xx) tests that persist to the database must create the referenced entity and use its real UUID

---

## Step 2 — Generate command files

Write one set of four files per domain to `.claude/commands/<domain>/`. File names are always `gen-endpoint-test.md`, `gen-flow-test.md`, `gen-component-test.md`, `gen-e2e-test.md` — the domain is encoded in the directory, not the filename.

Each file must follow the structure below, filled with real project data for that domain only.

Every section marked `<!-- from analysis -->` must be populated from what you read in Step 1.
Never leave placeholder text, never invent class names, never copy from the demo project.

### Cross-domain section (add to every file where a dependency was detected)

Add this section after the test data factories section, omit it entirely if no cross-domain dependency exists:

```
## Cross-domain dependencies

<!-- from analysis: only include domains this domain actually depends on -->

### <DependencyDomain> (required for <field> field)
To satisfy <RequestClass>.<field>, create a <DependencyDomain> resource first:

    <FactoryMethod>()              // e.g. TestUserRequests.createUser()
    <DataFactory>.default<Type>()  // e.g. TestUsers.defaultUser()

Typical setup pattern:
    <DependencyDto> dep = Pipeline.given(<FactoryMethod>())
            .then(httpClient.makeCall(<status>, <DependencyDto>.class))
            .execute();
    // use dep.<getId>() when building the request for this domain
```

-->

Now generate the e2e tests described in the argument: **$ARGUMENTS**
```

## Step 3 — Verify

After writing all files, confirm:
- One set of four files was generated per domain found
- No file contains classes or factories from a different domain
- Every class name in the generated commands exists in the project
- Every method signature in request/data factories matches the actual code
- Every field in the constraints table has a corresponding annotation in the source
- Cross-domain sections appear only where a real dependency was detected — not speculatively
- Cross-domain factory methods referenced exist in the project
- No placeholder text remains in any file
- All files reference `llm.md` in the MTO repo root for universal framework rules
